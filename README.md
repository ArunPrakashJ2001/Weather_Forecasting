# Weather_Forecasting

This revised project is all about working with time series data. The dataset moniters all parameters required to predict the weather monitered every 10 minutes. 
LSTM was used as there will be always be some dependency when working with time series data. We take 120 hours of past data to predict the temerature 12 hours in the future.
